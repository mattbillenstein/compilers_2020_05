# Write a Compiler : May 4-8, 2020

Hello! This is the course project repo for the "Write a Compiler"
course.  This project will serve as the central point of discussion, code
sharing, debugging, and other matters related to the compiler project.

Although each person will work on their own compiler, it is requested
that all participants work from this central project, but in a separate
branch.   You'll perform these setup steps:

    bash % git clone https://github.com/dabeaz/compilers_2020_05
    bash % cd compilers_2020_05
    bash % git checkout -b yourname
    bash % git push -u origin yourname

There are a couple of thought on this approach. First, it makes it
easier for me to look at your code and answer questions (you can 
point me at your code, raise an issue, etc.).   It also makes it easier
for everyone else to look at your code and to get ideas.  Writing a
compiler is difficult. Everyone is going to have different ideas about
the implementation, testing, and other matters.  By having all of the
code in one place and in different branches, it will be better.

I will also be using the repo to commit materials, solutions, and 
other things as the course nears and during the course.

Finally, the repo serves as a good historical record for everything
that happened during the course after the fact.

Best,
Dave

## Course Requirements

Here are some of the basic software requirements:

* Python 3.6 or newer.
* llvmlite
* Clang C/C++ compiler.

One easy way to get llvmlite is to install the Anaconda Python
distribution.  If you intend to write a compiler in a different
language than Python, you will need to investigate the availability of
tools for generating LLVM. There is probably some library similar to
llvmlite.
